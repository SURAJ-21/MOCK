Limited Functionality: The current Tableau regression functionality is restricted to a few dashboards and lacks test coverage, preventing scalability to user dashboards.
User Dependency: Users cannot configure or run regressions independently, relying on the tech team for changes and updates.
Automation Need: There's no record of Tableau dashboards configured for regression testing, necessitating automation and data destruction for obsolete dashboards.

Tableau Usage: WCAP team uses Tableau for visualizing and analyzing loan loss forecast results.
Modifications: Developers must ensure that changes in parameters, such as adding columns or changing formulas, do not affect other results.
Regression Testing: Implement regression testing to ensure reliability, allowing users to view, configure, and run regression tests for all dashboards.
