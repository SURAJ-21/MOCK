Inventory Management: Designed an inventory system for all Tableau dashboards, updating nightly to track new, deleted, or updated dashboards, including a separate inventory for regression-ready dashboards.
Automated Regression: Implemented a nightly job to run regressions on all configured dashboards, using Swagger to expose endpoints for user interaction, enabling them to view, baseline, and delete existing configurations.
Enhanced User Access: Provided users with downloadable CSV formats of Tableau dashboard views, stored as Parquet files on S3, allowing them to download, store, configure baselines, and run regressions for all types of dashboards.
